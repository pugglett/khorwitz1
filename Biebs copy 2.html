  <p class="text-primary"> Justin Bieber is a world wide phenomenon. He is a singer and songwriter from our neighbors to the north, Canada. He is not shy of success with his very first album "My World" becoming certified platinum right here in the states, and becoming the first artist to have seven of their songs from their debut album to appear on the billboard hot 100. Good job Mr. Biebs, if only I can be like you. The wonderful Justin has also released 2 more albums after that with 2 movies as well all debuting at number 1! Let's face it the Biebs is number 1, and your favorite artist is and always will be number 2. His fourth studio album "Purpose" is planned to drop at the end of 2015, and it will surely be face melting. Justin has also won many fan-voted awards because the fans speak the truth and know everything about music, especially prepubescent girls, their musical knowledge is very sound. It hasn't always been sunshine and rainbows for the Biebs though. As of recent he has been causing some stir in the media with his reckless behavior, but we all have moved on and kind of forget because he's hot ; ) </p>
